# Contributing

## Overview
This package is designed to seemlessly extend the behavior of the native `Uint8Array` class.


## Development

### Environment

- Developed using Node.js `v18.18.2`

### Building
No build required.  Vanilla JS only.

### Testing

To run all tests with logging
```
make test-debug
```

- `make test-unit-debug` - **Unit tests only**

> **NOTE:** remove `-debug` to run tests without logging
